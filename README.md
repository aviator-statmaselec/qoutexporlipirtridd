# Quotex Trading Candlestick Patterns - The Updated Guide (2024)

## Introduction

Candlestick patterns are key indicators on financial charts, offering
insights into market sentiment and price movements. These patterns
emerge from the open, high, low, and close prices of a security within a
given period and are crucial for making informed trading decisions. The
aim is to identify potential market reversals or trends, helping you
make better decisions and potentially increase your earnings.

## About Candlesticks

\### How Are Candlesticks Formed on a Trading Chart? Candlesticks are
like the X-ray vision of a market. You can see what's happening under
the surface, like changes in a market's strength and direction and how
emotions shape the trends. Each candlestick represents price information
in a specific unit of time, such as one trading day in a daily chart,
one hour in an hourly chart, and so on. By changing the time frame on a
chart, the candlesticks will also change accordingly. Let's look into
the components of candlesticks next to understand how they form and what
they represent. \### Candlestick Components The four components of a
candlestick are the \*\*open\*\*, \*\*close\*\*, \*\*high\*\*, and
\*\*low\*\* prices for a specific time period. Let's look at an example
of a daily candle: \![Anatomy of a
Candlestick\](img/anatomy-of-a-candlestick.png)

\* The open price is the first price at which the asset trades in one
specific day. \* The close price is the last price at which the asset
trades in one specific day. \* The high price is the highest price the
asset reaches during the day. \* The low price is the lowest price
reached during the day. \### The Candlestick Body The area between the
opening and closing prices is called the body. The color of a
candlestick body indicates a bullish or bearish price movement. If the
opening price is lower than the closing price, the body color is green.
Conversely, if the opening price is lower than the closing price, the
body color is red. Different platforms display different colors, but
these are the most common. The size of the candlestick body itself
offers valuable information to traders. The longer the body, the more
bullish or bearish the candlestick is. A very long red body indicates
aggressive selling (fear), and a long green body indicates strong
adoption (optimism) in a market. \### Upper Shadow and Lower Shadow
Almost every candle has so-called shadows (or wicks). The thin line
between the top of the body and the high of the trading period is called
the \*\*upper shadow\*\*. And the line between the bottom of the body
and the low is called the \*\*lower shadow\*\*. The length and
positioning of the shadows provide key indications of market behavior.
When the upper shadow is relatively long, it suggests that prices were
driven higher during the session but encountered selling pressure or
profit-taking near the peak. This could signify potential resistance
levels or bearish sentiment coming into play. Conversely, a short upper
shadow may imply that buyers remained dominant throughout the session,
indicating a strong bullish sentiment.

## Bullish Candlestick Patterns

Bullish candlestick patterns indicate a higher probability of upward
price movement. It typically suggests that buyers are in control,
driving prices even higher. Bullish patterns often exhibit
characteristics such as larger green bodies, long lower shadows, and
short upper shadows. These patterns can signify a potential trend
reversal, continuation of an existing uptrend, or the formation of a
support level. \| \*\*Bullish Patterns\*\* \| \*\*Description\*\* \|

price movement. It implies that sellers are exerting influence and
driving prices lower. Bearish patterns often feature larger red bodies,
